# The Staywell

### by Hildred N. Baker (Nikki)

Visit my website here (https://www.stayneartheark.com) when hosted on AWS in the near future.

Welcome to The Staywell. This project is designed to serve two purposes:

1.  Satisfy requirements to pass Code Louisville's Web Development Part 2 (Thursday Night) Class.
2.  To provide my own short-term rental booking site for an Airbnb that we own and will be running (hopefully) starting in April 2023.

### How to View My Project with Visual Studio Code (Skip to #5 if you already know what you're doing.)

1.  To view this project, you'll need to first [download Visual Studio Code here,](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) open, and run the file.
2.  Next, you will need to download an extension called "Live Server". You can do this by clicking the "Extensions" Icon (looks like 4 blocks) at the bottom of the left sidebar or by clicking Cntrl+Shift+X and searching for "Live Server". Hit the "Install" button.
3.  Then, you will need to clone [this repository](https://github.com/nikkimnik/TheStaywell.git) inside Visual Studio Code.
4.  Clicking on the blue link in #3, will take you to the repository you want to clone in Github. Once there, click on the Green <>CODE button close to the top-right of the page and hit the COPY icon. This will copy the link to the repository you are cloning.
5.  Go back to Visual Studio Code and click on "Terminal" in the navigation bar at the top, then "New Terminal".
6.  Type "git clone" at the prompt and paste in your copied link -- i.e. "git clone https://github.com/nikkimnik/TheStaywell.git".
7.  Visual studio code will download/clone the repository to the file/directory that you are already in or you can "cd" to a new directory before cloning.
8.  Go to "File" in the navigation bar at the top and open the folder location where you cloned the repository.
9.  Click on the HTML Folder and find the HTML File you want to view. Click "Go Live" at the bottom right of the page. A browswer window will pop up to show you a live version of the HTML page you chose to view.
10. Do this for each HTML page you would like to view.

### Special Requirements to Satisfy Code Louisville's Web Dev Part 2 Project

1.  "Use a regular expression to validate user input and inform the user about it" -- see the contactus.html page.
2.  "Calculate and display data based on an external factor (get current date and display time remaining until an event)" -- see the booknow.html page.
3.  "Use arrays, objects, sets, or maps to store and retrieve information that is displayed in your app." - see the the localattractions.html page.
4.  "Retrieve data from a third-party API and use it to display something within your app." I have displayed a Google Map with my Airbnb's location marked. I have an API key for The Google Maps JS API, and I have plotted 3 points on the map -- my airbnb, a midpoint used to center the map on the page, and the local tourist attraction that everybody comes to town to visit (The Ark Encounter). I just didn't have time to figure out how to hide the API key successfully in the .env file to use in this project.

# This Site is a Work In Progress

### I have worked on MANY additional features that were listed in Code Louisville's Project Requirements as well.

I like that the features assigned are completely relevent to REAL WORLD applications, so before this website is launched, I should be using the following work-in-progress features too.

1. The Node.js server, for example, was working, then stopped working (repeat, etc.), so I was afraid to use that feature to fulfill an actual requirement of this project.
2. My Order Confirmation page (orderconfirmation.html) will ultimately "use a function that accepts 2 or more input parameters and returns a value that is calculated or determined by the inputs" and creates a custom confirmation number.

## Thank you for checking out my project! I hope you like it!!
